<p>‚ÄúMarley was dead: to begin with.‚Äù</p>

<p>I decided to start with someone else‚Äôs beginning because starting something new is quite challenging. If I‚Äôve learned one thing from the past year spent becoming a software developer, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs no shame in standing on the shoulders of giants. I use that turn of phrase because it sounds so much better than copy and paste!</p>

<p>To paraphrase two men named John, I‚Äôm older than I‚Äôve ever been, and now I‚Äôm even older! Age alone, however, guarantees neither the accumulation of knowledge nor wisdom.</p>

<p>My last year has gone by more quickly than any years prior, which is to be expected, however this year was quite unique.</p>

<p>I had been contemplating my next career move for quite some time. I enjoyed many aspects of the past near decade supporting Apple products over the phone and repairing them at two retail stores. Learning and applying new knowledge was my favorite part of the job. I had reached a point where I felt my learning begin to slow, however.</p>

<p>Mobile devices and portable computers got more advanced and usually smaller. Components in new machines began to be integrated into fewer circuit boards. Repairs on desktops, the most fun repairs in my humble opinion, became less frequent in line with Apple‚Äôs business shifting primarily to mobile devices. Mobile repairs, while still enjoyable were coming in at a much higher rate. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon to spend the majority of an eight hour work day hunched over a repair bench doing the same repair over and over.</p>

<p>I was also personally grappling with issues related to my ADHD, which I was diagnosed with as a child, but for which I was never formally treated. I found aspects inherent to the retail schedule, specifically its fluctuant nature, particularly unsuitable for the atypical way my mind worked. While I had made great strides over the years at Apple, like maintaining an over 90% customer satisfaction score while at AppleCare, or frequently exceeding expectations on performance evaluations when working at the retail stores, I still felt I was not fully playing to my strengths.</p>
