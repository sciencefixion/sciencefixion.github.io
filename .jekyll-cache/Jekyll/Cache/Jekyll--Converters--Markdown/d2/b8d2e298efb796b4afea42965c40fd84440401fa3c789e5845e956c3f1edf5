<p>I decided to start with someone else’s beginning because starting something new is quite challenging. If I’ve learned one thing from the past year spent becoming a software developer, it’s that there’s no shame in standing on the shoulders of giants. I use that turn of phrase because it sounds so much better than copy and paste!</p>

<p>My last year has gone by more quickly than any years prior, which is to be expected, however this year was quite unique. I had been contemplating my next career move for quite some time.</p>

<p>I enjoyed many aspects of the past near decade supporting Apple products over the phone and repairing them at two retail stores. Learning and applying new knowledge was my favorite part of the job. I had reached a point where I felt my learning begin to slow, however. Mobile devices and portable computers got more advanced and smaller. Components in new machines began to be integrated into fewer circuit boards. Repairs on desktops, the most fun repairs in my humble opinion, became less frequent in line with Apple’s business shifting primarily to mobile devices. Mobile repairs, while still enjoyable were coming in at a much higher rate. It wasn’t uncommon to spend an one to be hunched over a repair bench.</p>

<p>To paraphrase two men named John, I’m older than I’ve ever been, and now I’m even older! Age alone, however, guarantees neither the accumulation of knowledge nor wisdom.</p>
