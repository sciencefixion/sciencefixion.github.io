excerpt: Thanks to my partner, family, and friends who've continued to support me through the various stages of my life. Thanks to everyone a Turing School of Software & Design, especially the instructors in the back end program and anyone who was in the 2005 cohort for any length of time. You all have helped me in ways beyond what I can express. My career as a software engineer would not have gone from dream to reality without all of you.

I hope the knowledge that I've gained through all my years of learning can be a tribute and benefit those without which it would not have been possible as well as promote authentic connection and cooperation with those I have the privilege of interacting with in the future.
